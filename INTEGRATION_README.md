# AI Utilities Integration

I've successfully integrated your 3 AI utilities into your React-based AI Toolbox website. Here's what I've added and how to set it up.

## 🆕 New Utilities Added

### 1. Speech to Text (STT)
- **Path:** `/stt`
- **Features:** 
  - Record audio directly from microphone
  - Upload audio/video files for transcription
  - Auto-detect between English and Hindi
  - Download transcripts as text files

### 2. Confidence Analyzer
- **Path:** `/confidence-analyzer`
- **Features:**
  - Analyze presentation skills from video recordings
  - Audio metrics: volume, pitch variation, speech rate, filler words
  - Visual metrics: eye contact, posture, smile quantity, hand gestures
  - Download detailed analysis reports

### 3. Face & Voice Detector
- **Path:** `/face-voice-detector`
- **Features:**
  - Detect human faces in video using OpenCV
  - Detect voice activity in audio tracks
  - Comprehensive analysis results with technical details

## 🚀 Quick Start (Demo Mode)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup (Demo Server)
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install demo requirements
pip install -r demo_requirements.txt

# Start the demo server
python demo_server.py
```

The demo server runs on `http://localhost:5000` and returns mock data for testing the frontend.

## 🔧 Full Production Setup

For full functionality with your original Python utilities, you'll need to:

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up Models
- Ensure Vosk models are in the correct paths for STT
- Install required ML libraries (OpenCV, MediaPipe, Whisper, etc.)

### 3. Run Production Server
```bash
python backend/server.py
```

## 🌐 Access Your New Tools

Once both servers are running:

1. **Main Dashboard:** `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite dev server port)
2. **Speech to Text:** `http://localhost:5173/stt`
3. **Confidence Analyzer:** `http://localhost:5173/confidence-analyzer`
4. **Face & Voice Detector:** `http://localhost:5173/face-voice-detector`

## ✨ Features

### UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Consistent design with your existing TTS page
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- ✅ File upload with drag-and-drop areas
- ✅ Real-time status updates and progress indicators
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

### Technical Features
- ✅ React TypeScript components
- ✅ Flask backend API with CORS support
- ✅ File upload handling with security checks
- ✅ Structured API responses
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Demo:** Start with the demo server to see the UI in action
2. **Set up Full Backend:** Install the required Python packages for full functionality
3. **Customize:** Adjust the UI components or add more features as needed
4. **Deploy:** When ready, deploy both frontend and backend to your preferred hosting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues:** Make sure the backend server is running with CORS enabled
- **File Upload Limits:** Check the MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH in the Flask config
- **Python Dependencies:** Some packages like OpenCV and MediaPipe can be tricky to install
- **Model Paths:** Ensure Vosk models are in the correct directories
